# openclaw-self-healing

OpenClaw plugin that improves resilience by automatically fixing reversible failures.

## What it can heal (v0.2)

Implemented now:

- Model outage healing
  - Detect rate limit / quota / auth-scope failures
  - Put the affected model into cooldown
  - Patch pinned session model overrides to a safe fallback (prevents endless `API rate limit reached` loops)

- WhatsApp disconnect healing
  - If WhatsApp appears disconnected repeatedly: restart the gateway
  - Guardrails: streak threshold + minimum restart interval

- Cron failure healing (optional)
  - If a cron job fails repeatedly: disable it
  - Create a GitHub issue with last error context (rate limited)

Not implemented yet (next):
- Plugin install error rollback (disable plugin) based on structured plugin status
  - Waiting for `openclaw plugins list --json` or an equivalent stable API

## Install (dev)

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ~/.openclaw/workspace/openclaw-self-healing
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Config

```json

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

Infrastructure changes remain ask-first.

## Critical Guardrail: openclaw.json validation

This plugin treats `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` as a boot-critical file.

Before any self-heal action that could restart the gateway or change cron/plugin state, it verifies:
- the config file exists
- it is valid JSON

If the config is invalid, the plugin will refuse to restart the gateway to avoid restart loops.

It also creates timestamped backups before restarts or disruptive changes:
`~/.openclaw/backups/openclaw.json/openclaw.json.<timestamp>.bak`
